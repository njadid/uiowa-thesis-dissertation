this is a (semi-official?) minimalistic template that resembles the word template provided the grad college of uiowa (see [here](https://www.grad.uiowa.edu/academics/thesis-and-dissertation/preparing-formatting))

while the template conforms to the requirement and has been checked by the thesis examiner [Erin Kaufman](erin-kaufman@uiowa.edu), you might still receive feedback to correct your thesis format due to long tables or other issues.
